Be as thorough as you can, since some weeds can regenerate from even a tiny amount of root left behind. Simple digging, as the process is known, involves using gardening tools to turn over the top layer of your garden's soil and clear it of debris. Use a shovel or spade to loosen the top layer of soil, breaking up any large clumps and removing rocks or other debris, before you plant. Composting, a natural process of recycling organic matter into fertilizer, has many benefits for your soil and your plants, including retaining nutrients and water more effectively. Once you've prepared your soil, you're ready to start planting.",

We're just a few weeks away from fresh flowers, stunning color and eye-catching spring gardens. Though the official start of spring is March 20th, why wait to check out the plants and trees you need to make your spring garden second to none? When it comes to the ever-popular Tulip Poplar, you might initially think of its rich, dazzling fall color, lining streets with gold autumnal tones. But did you know that the Tulip is known for its spring blooms? Though it doesn't boast blooms, the Weeping Willow is well-suited for springtime. I mean, who doesn't love graceful, soft green shade? It's the perfect backdrop to some of your more colorful plants and trees. We can't talk about spring without mentioning the timeless White Dogwood. Deeply-toned green foliage with a simple smattering of sizable white blooms set the Southern Magnolia Tree apart. And it's a pretty iconic tree, known for being synonymous with warm, pleasant temperatures and sunny days. Imagine large pink blossoms that emerge early each spring like clockwork. With the Debutante Camellia, it's a promise. So, from the Tulip Poplar to the Weeping Willow or iconic Camellia, you'll be ahead of the game for spring. And there's nothing like planning for our favorite months of the year!",

The plant is dry and asking for water. Check the soil. Get up close and personal with your plant and stick your finger into the potting mix, down to your first knuckle. If it feels moist, don’t water. If the soil feels dry. Go ahead. It’s time to water.",
