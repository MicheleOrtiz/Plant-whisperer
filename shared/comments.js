        "text": "-HOW DO YOU PREPARE SOIL FOR SPRING? Before you plant in spring, you'll want to remove any weeds present in your planting area. Be as thorough as you can, since some weeds can regenerate from even a tiny amount of root left behind. Simple digging, as the process is known, involves using gardening tools to turn over the top layer of your garden's soil and clear it of debris. Use a shovel or spade to loosen the top layer of soil, breaking up any large clumps and removing rocks or other debris, before you plant. Composting, a natural process of recycling organic matter into fertilizer, has many benefits for your soil and your plants, including retaining nutrients and water more effectively. Once you've prepared your soil, you're ready to start planting.",

Once your spring plants are in the ground, you'll want to carefully nurture them to maximize their growth, especially during the first growing season until they're fully established. Water plants well immediately after planting, and water when the soil is dry after that. Fertilize according to your specific plant's care instructions. Our guide to fertilizing plants covers everything you need to know about maximizing plant growth.",

We're just a few weeks away from fresh flowers, stunning color and eye-catching spring gardens. Though the official start of spring is March 20th, why wait to check out the plants and trees you need to make your spring garden second to none? When it comes to the ever-popular Tulip Poplar, you might initially think of its rich, dazzling fall color, lining streets with gold autumnal tones. But did you know that the Tulip is known for its spring blooms? Though it doesn't boast blooms, the Weeping Willow is well-suited for springtime. I mean, who doesn't love graceful, soft green shade? It's the perfect backdrop to some of your more colorful plants and trees. We can't talk about spring without mentioning the timeless White Dogwood. Deeply-toned green foliage with a simple smattering of sizable white blooms set the Southern Magnolia Tree apart. And it's a pretty iconic tree, known for being synonymous with warm, pleasant temperatures and sunny days. Imagine large pink blossoms that emerge early each spring like clockwork. With the Debutante Camellia, it's a promise. So, from the Tulip Poplar to the Weeping Willow or iconic Camellia, you'll be ahead of the game for spring. And there's nothing like planning for our favorite months of the year!",

Consider the size of your containers; annuals need at least 8 inches of soil. For multiple plants, look for containers at least 12 inches wide.",

They often droop or wrinkle when the plant is thirsty. Lift the plant up. Pot and all. Does it feel heavy? If it does, there is still enough water in the soil. Light as a feather? The plant is dry and asking for water. Check the soil. Get up close and personal with your plant and stick your finger into the potting mix, down to your first knuckle. If it feels moist, don’t water. If the soil feels dry. Go ahead. It’s time to water.",
